<h2>Introduction to Interfaces</h2>

<p> Now that we know that Queue is an interface it is important that we understand Interfaces before examining its uses and methods .</p>

<p> <em> Interfaces</em>  are similar to classes because they contain methods and variables. However, methods declared in an interface are abstract, meaning they have no body. This means that Interface objects cannot be created. Classes that implement an interface can create objects but they must implement all of its methods.</p>


<p> You should read up on interfaces. Check out <a href = https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html> this explanation which gives an example of how an interface can be implemented.<a/> <p/>
