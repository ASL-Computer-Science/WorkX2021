<h2> Intro to Queue's </h2>

<p> A Queue is a linear data structure similar to the ArrayList. Unlike ArrayLists Queue's follow <b>FIFO </b> (First in First Out) order. This means that items can only be <b> added to the back of the queue </b> and <b>removed from the front</b>. This is similar to how queues or checkout lines function in real life. </p>
