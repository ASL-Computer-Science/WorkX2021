<h2> Linked List</h2>

<p> The Linked List data structure is a linear structure like the ArrayList.
    Each element in the structure is a separate
    object with a data part and an address part. Each element is called a <b> node</b>. Elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Like Queues elements are processed in FIFO order. However it has methods that allow the user to add an element to the front of the list and remove from the back.</p>

<p> Using the resources above figure out what the output of this section of code is.</p>

<p> Queue q = new LinkedList<> </p>

    <p>q.add(1) </p>
    <p> q.add(2)</p>
<p> q.add(3);</p>
<p> q.add(4);</p>
<p> q.remove();</p>
