The main repository holds a folder for each participant.

Using the web interface to Github, please take the parent folder for your IntelliJ project and drag and drop it into the folder with your name.

Finally, click Commit to save the changes.  Let me know when you've added your files so I can take a look and make certain that the system reflects your contributions.  I'll let you know if there are any issues.
