<h2>Cycle Detection</h2>
<p>In this task, make a method to determine if there is a cycle in an undirected graph. A
graph has a cycle if there is an unbroken series of nodes with no repeating nodes or
edges that connects back to itself. The graph on the left has a
cycle in the image below, while the graph on the right does not. You can change the method parameters
which are given, but they are there to help you.</p>

<div class="hint">Modify the DFS or BFS algorithm. You want to return true if you encounter
a vertex you have already seen before, but with some exceptions.</div>
