<h2>Directed Graphs</h2>
<p>Before we went over that directed graphs are graphs where connections between nodes have weight and may not be symmetric.
    Look at the graph below, for example. We can see that
    each edge has two things that undirected graphs do not have, direction and weight.
    Another thing to clarify, in the image, node 6 has two children, which are nodes 9 and 7.
    Nodes 5 and 1 are not children of node 6 because there is no edge/connection starting from
    node 6 going to nodes 5 or 1.</p>
