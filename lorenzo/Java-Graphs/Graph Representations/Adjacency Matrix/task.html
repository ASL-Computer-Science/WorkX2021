    <h2>Adjacency Matrix</h2>
    <p>In the previous lesson, you created a graph using a Vertex and an Edge class. However,
    there are many ways to create graphs, and this lesson will go over two of them. The
    first way is with an adjacency matrix. An adjacency matrix is a 2D square array used
    to represent a finite undirected or directed graph. If the graph is undirected, the
    adjacency matrix is symmetric across the diagonal. The way an adjacency matrix works is
    the number of nodes in the graph is the length/width of the matrix, so if your graph
    has five nodes, the length/width of the adjacency matrix would be five. Then each value
    in the matrix represents an edge or the weight of an edge between two nodes. For
    example, let's say the value in the cell [3][1] (row 3, column 1) is 20. This means there
    is a connection from node 4 to node 2 that has a weight of 20. It is nodes 4 and 2
    because indices in Java start at 0, so index 0 will be node 1. In an undirected graph,
    each weight would be 1, representing a connection between two nodes.</p>
    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Below is an example of an undirected adjacency matrix. We can see there is an edge
    between nodes 4 and 5 because the value of cell [3][4] is 1.</p>

    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>Now try to solve this multiple choice question. Which of the following adjacency
    matrices creates the graph shown below? A, B, or C?</p>
