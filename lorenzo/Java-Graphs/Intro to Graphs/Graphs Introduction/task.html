    <h1>Introduction to Graphs</h1>
    <p>You have probably already encountered graphs in your day-to-day life. Any network
        can be represented by a Graph, such as a social network consisting of you and your
        friends or a telephone network in a city. In Java, Graphs are a data structure
        consisting of a finite set of <strong>nodes</strong> (also called vertices) and a
        finite set of <strong>edges</strong> (also called connections or ordered pairs).
        Let's use Facebook as a social network as an example. In this case, each person
        would be a unique node, and friendships between people would be represented as
        connections.</p>
    <h2>Example Graph</h2>

    <p>If we look in the image above, we can see that the five unique nodes represent
        five people, and the connections represent friendships. For example, Person Two
        is friends with Person Three but not Person Four. It is also important to note
        that this example would be an undirected Graph. The direction/orientation of
        connections does not matter as friendships are "symmetrical" on Facebook. To add
        some vocabulary, the "children" of a node are all nodes that have an edge
        with that node. If we look at the example graph, the children of node 2 would be
        nodes 1 and 3.</p>
    <h2>Undirected and Directed Graphs</h2>
    <p>This module will focus on undirected graphs. However, it is still
        important to know what directed graphs are. Undirected graphs have edges that do
        not have a direction between two nodes. This means that if you are at a node
        in a graph, you can travel along any of its edges as it is undirected. Another
        interpretation is that the weight of the edges is independent of the orientation
        or direction you are traveling in. Directed graphs are the opposite, the
        direction or orientation you travel on its edges matters. To give an example
        of this, let's use the image above. In an undirected graph, each edge has one
        weight, and it doesn't matter the direction in which you travel that edge. In a
        directed graph, the direction matters. Let's look at the edge between node 1 and
        node 2. If it were an undirected graph, we can say the weight of this edge
        does not matter if you are going from node 1 to node 2 or from node 2 to node 1.
        In a directed graph, the weights could be the same. Meaning the weight of the
        edge going from node 1 to node 2 could have a value of 10, and the weight of the
        edge going from node 2 to node 1 could have a value of 7.</p>
