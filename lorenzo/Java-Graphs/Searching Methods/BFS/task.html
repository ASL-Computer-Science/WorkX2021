<h1>BFS Practice</h1>
<p>For this task, you will not be given an algorithm for help. Try to use what you learned
when you created the DFS method. The only hint given is in the parameters for the BFS method (but again, you can change the parameters if you want). You will also have to create the graph shown below, using <code>Vertex</code>
    objects and the <code>addEdge</code> method of the Vertex class.</p>

<div class="hint">Here is the same animated gif of BFS to help you. (Extra hint, black represents the node you are currently
searching, and gray represents the nodes in the queue of nodes you will search next).</div>
