<h2>Adjacency List</h2>
<p>Another way to represent graphs in Java is with an adjacency list. It is quite similar
to an adjacency matrix. However, it is an array of lists (not an array list!) instead of
a 2D array. The size of the array is the number of nodes in the graph. Let the array be
array[], a list at array[i] represents the nodes with an edge with the ith node. In
order to represent a weighted graph, you would need a list of pairs for each node. Each
pair would then have the node that it connects to and the weight of the edge.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Take a look at the image below. In the adjacency list, you can see the array of lists,
where the first list is for node 1, the second list is for node 2, and so on. Then each value
in those lists represents nodes that connect to the node for the list. For example, the
nodes in the 3rd node's list are 1, 2, and 4, meaning that node 3 connects to nodes 1, 2,
and 4.</p>

<p>For a directed graph, you need to adjust the list to a list of pairs. The first value
in the pair is the node to connect to, and the second value in the pair is the weight of the
edge. In the image below, we can see the pair {3,3} in the 2nd node's list. This means there
is an edge going from the 2nd node to the 3rd node that has a weight of 3.</p>
