    <h1>Graph Exercise</h1>
    <h3>In this task you will be assessed with your output in Main.Java</h3>
    <p>There is a <strong>Vertex (node)</strong> class for you to use in this task.
        The <strong>Vertex</strong> class has one parameter in its constructor, the name of the vertex
        (String object). The
        constructor can be seen here: <code>public Vertex(String name)</code>. There is also a hidden
        <strong>Edge</strong> class that you will not be using in this task.</p>
    <p>Your task is to recreate the graph shown below, using the <strong>Vertex</strong> class.
        The <strong>Vertex</strong> class has the method <strong>addEdge</strong> which allows you
        to create an edge between two vertices. Here is the method header: <code>public void addEdge(Vertex vertex2)
        </code>. You do not need to create an edge twice. Ff you create an edge off of one vertex connecting to another, the other vertex will also be aware of that edge. After you have recreated the graph, output your answers to the following questions using
        <code>System.out.println(/*ANSWER HERE*/);</code> for each question. Make sure the name for vertex 0 is "zero",
        and for vertex 1 its "one" and so on</p>

    <p>The first Vertex and Edge are already created for you.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Print the variable for vertex 4</li>
        <li>Print the variable for vertex 6</li>
        <li>How many children does vertex 2 have?</li>
        <li>How many edges does vertex 0 have?</li>
        <li>Print out what the method <code>ArrayList&lt;Vertex&gt; getChildren()</code> of the <strong>Vertex</strong>
            class returns for the vertex 7 object</li>
    </ol>
