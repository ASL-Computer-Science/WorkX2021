    <h2>Search Methods</h2>
    <p>Now that we have a graph, what can we do with it? One real-world problem that
        networks face is finding out the shortest path between two nodes or if a path
        exists connecting two nodes. There are many ways to solve these two questions,
        but we will go over three main algorithms.</p>
    <h3>Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>
    <p>This algorithm is for finding if there exists a path between two nodes in a graph.
        It is also the simplest of the three which you will learn. The algorithm works by
        starting at the root node (one of the two nodes you are given) and explores as far
        as possible along each connection before backtracking. </p>

    <p>If you were to take the image above and use DFS to find if a connection exists
        between nodes 1 and 7, the algorithm would check the following nodes in this
        order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and find that a connection does exist. Below is another
        animated example of DFS.</p>

    <h3>Breadth First Search (BFS)</h3>
    <p>This algorithm is also for finding if there exists a path between two nodes in a graph.
        The algorithm works by starting at the root node (one of the two nodes you are given)
        and exploring all of the root node's children. If any of those children are the desired
        node, then the algorithm stops. If not, the algorithm continues by checking the children
        of those children, and so on.</p>

    <p>If you were to take the image above and use BFS to find if a connection exists
        between nodes 1 and 9, the algorithm would check the following nodes in this
        order: 1, 2, 7, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, and find that a connection does exist. Below is another
        animated example of BFS (gray represents children found, black represents searched
        nodes).</p>

    <h3>Dijkstra's Algorithm</h3>
    <p>Before you read about this algorithm, just know you will not be expected to create it.
    Dijkstra's Algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a directed/weighted
    graph, however it will also work for finding paths in undirected graphs. A brief description for
    how the algorithm works is that it creates a tree of shortest paths from the starting vertex
    to all other points in the graph. If you are interested in learning more about Dijkstra's Algorithm,
    <a href='https://brilliant.org/wiki/dijkstras-short-path-finder/' target='_blank'>this link</a>
        goes over what it is, how to implement it, and examples of using it. I'd recommend checking
    it out!</p>
