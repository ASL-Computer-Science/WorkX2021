<h2>Test Question 1: Test Scores</h2>

<p>Your task is to write a method that finds the students who received an
A+ (98 or above) on their test. The method will take in a HashMap of key type String
and value type Integer and return an ArrayList of type String. The HashMap
represents the students' names and their corresponding test scores, and the returned
ArrayList will be the list of the <b>names of students</b> that got a high grade.</p>

<p>Preconditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100</li>
    <li>All of the keys are valid student names</li>
</ul>

<div class="hint">You can get a Collection of the map's keys using the keySet() method.</div>
